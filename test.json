    "https://rhoimpact.com/esg-blog/supporting-esg-with-data-science/": "Supporting ESG Work with Data Science |Rho ImpactServicesProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingCRANE ToolAboutOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactNewsESG BlogPress ReleaseMedia CoverageCareersJob OpportunitiesBenefitsSign inContact UsMenuServicesProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingCRANE ToolNewsESG BlogPress ReleaseMedia CoverageAboutOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactCareersJob OpeningsBenefitsContact UsSupporting ESG Work with Data ScienceBy  · January 23, 2023ESG planning, tracking, and reporting is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, but with new regulations beginning to standardize the disclosure of environmental, social, and governance factors, the work has to be done. As a result, there has been a growth in sustainability software powered by data science methods (e.g. machine learning, AI) to facilitate tracking and reporting. Data science can help in many ways, but it does have its limits.\n\nThe term “data science” often gets thrown around as if it is a one-stop solution for outstanding challenges and problems. Want to know how your product will impact the environmental footprint of your target customers? Data science. Want to screen new and promising sustainable technologies? Data science. We like to think that the more data we throw at a problem, the more answers we’ll get. However, integrating with a million existing systems to “unlock your data” will only get you so far if you’re not intentional about the data you’re gathering. It could even result in more questions than answers, reducing the possibility of building a collective understanding. In order to meet your objectives, you need to identify the appropriate data that will answer your questions, which requires genuine domain expertise.\n\n\nWhat’s more, the typical “black box” model of feeding your data into a system that performs some incomprehensible transformations to provide you with an unverifiable output is not going to be sufficient in this new era of disclosures. Stakeholders need to understand—actually understand—key indicators and assumptions that drive the results, and there needs to be a clear line of sight from the original data so that the results can be validated and trusted. In a thorough study we recently conducted with the help of CRANE’s users, accountability and transparency were the top priorities.  All that being said, despite its limits, there are some ways that data science can help throughout the process.\n\nData Collection\nEstablishing your baseline metrics as outlined in standards like SASB, TCFD, or GRI, is one of the most arduous undertakings for any ESG program. When reporting on these metrics, you need to back up your data with auditable documentation, aka. evidence. The number of documents you may end up sifting through can become immense, making the task both time-consuming and overwhelming. Natural language processing can help facilitate this work by automating the identification and organization of relevant documents needed to paint a clear picture of your current ESG performance, establish data baselines, and identify blind spots.\nAnalysis\n\nOnce you’ve collected your data, whether it be documents to support your baseline metrics or survey responses to materiality assessments, your structured and unstructured data can be transformed into data-driven insights. Forward-looking predictions and scenario analyses can help your organization evaluate its potential and directly inform the strategic vision and long-term goals of your ESG program. Optimizations on your supply chain can identify major risks and actionable steps to maximize your results. As you track, analytics can help you determine if you’re going to meet your ESG goals or help make necessary corrections. But graphs, tables, and automated insights are only useful if they are reducible to relevant actions and better decisions on the ground. Remember, ESG is really a story about people and things, and we shouldn’t allow ourselves to get lost in abstract concepts or convoluted metrics.\n\nVerification\n\nYou’ll need to produce a full report to effectively communicate your ESG practices, but we also often advise those in the early stages of their ESG journey to start by creating an interim ESG report that outlines what you have done to kickstart your journey and list next steps as well as long-term goals that you’re actively pursuing. The focus of this report should be transparency and definitive aspirations, which can be supported by data to provide evidence of your efforts so far. The data should be verifiable, meaning that there is a clear connection to primary sources (e.g. auditable documentation). Having a good data management system, such as that provided by Gemini, will help your organization lay the breadcrumbs from source documentation to reported values so that you can disclose your ESG practices with confidence. \n\n\nSo is data science the panacea to your ESG questions and challenges? Probably not. But data science tools and methods can help facilitate the process of implementing and managing your organization’s ESG strategy. It can automate parts of the data collection process. Combined with ESG domain expertise, analytical insights can be transformed into decisions and actions. And a good data management system makes it easy to connect reported disclosures with primary sources. Ultimately, it is data science paired with ESG expertise, not data science alone, that will help you answer your ESG questions. \nBack to the blogPrivacy Policy · ESG · Security · TermsProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingServicesCRANE ToolCompanyHomeOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactESG BlogRho Impact NewsSign up for our NewsletterGet the latest news and articles to your inbox every month.EmailThanks for subscribing!",
    "https://rhoimpact.com/esg-blog/top-3-things-every-supply-chain-leader-needs-to-know/": "​​​​The Top 3 Things Supply Chain Leaders Need to Know In The “Age of ESG” |Rho ImpactServicesProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingCRANE ToolAboutOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactNewsESG BlogPress ReleaseMedia CoverageCareersJob OpportunitiesBenefitsSign inContact UsMenuServicesProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingCRANE ToolNewsESG BlogPress ReleaseMedia CoverageAboutOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactCareersJob OpeningsBenefitsContact Us​​​​The Top 3 Things Supply Chain Leaders Need to Know In The “Age of ESG”By  · August 18, 2022In the last couple of years, we as a global society have faced unprecedented environmental, social, and economic challenges. The multifaceted impacts of the COVID pandemic, the environmental destruction from wildfires in Australia, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are just a few examples. These events impacted every stakeholder, supply chain, and industry worldwide  (2022 Accenture report). Our global citizens experienced empty shelves in grocery stores, a lack of critical medical equipment, and a shortage of daily necessities. These disruptions demonstrated the fragility of global supply chains and the need to develop a new model for sourcing and supply chain management.\n\nIn addition to operational disruptions, significant shifts in consumer preferences and employee expectations have encouraged companies to modify their supply chain management to comply with evolving human rights and environmental standards. Given the current volatility and associated risks companies are grappling with, it is crucial that organizations adapt their supply chains to reflect these new market realities and pressures. Integrating ESG into your supply chain management can bridge the gap between today’s stakeholder expectations and tomorrow’s market realities.\n\nWhat is ESG, and why it is relevant to my supply chain?\nThe Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework assesses how a company manages the risks and opportunities created by shifting market conditions and stakeholder expectations. Using ESG as a core driver of your business model allows you to create and sustain long-term value in a rapidly changing world. Operational risks can also be reduced while enhancing strategic and financial opportunities. ESG has become a necessity for public and brand-name companies as emerging ESG disclosure regulations are going into effect in all major markets worldwide.  For this reason, ESG has become a leading priority for companies of all sizes, and in every industry.  Supply chain management presents some of the most critical ESG risks and opportunities to navigate.\n\nIn their 2021 Annual Global Supply Chain Report, Intros found that, on average, organizations lose $184 million annually due to global supply chain disruptions. ESG aids suppliers in addressing these ongoing issues through strategic, financial, and operational lenses. The ESG framework emphasizes better monitoring and maintenance of environmental and social conduct along supply chains, mitigating associated risks and disruptions. Issues such as human rights adherence, labor management, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental performance are identified and addressed preemptively – reducing the likelihood of reputational and operational crises as it relates to your suppliers. This is just one of the many examples that demonstrate how ESG can help mitigate supply chain risks.\n\nESG and Supply Chain Management - The Three Things Every Supplier Must Know:\n\nAs mentioned above, supply chains represent the bulk of an organization’s emissions footprint as well as most of their associated environmental and social impacts.  Supply chain leaders are in a unique position to leverage their ESG efforts as a tool in reducing the collective impacts of their downstream buyers while also standing out in the procurement process. Given the range of environmental, social, and governance risks and opportunities the supply chain presents, these are the three things every supplier must know in the ‘age of ESG’.\n\n\n\nNew Regulation, New Normal In 2021, the United State Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) published its Proposed Rules for, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures. Within these guidelines, both public companies and ESG funds must include clear and consistent disclosures on how they are integrating ESG into their strategies, risk management processes, corporate governance, and stakeholder management.  As public companies look to quantify and disclose the environmental and social performance of their supply chains, suppliers with explicit ESG policies, practices, programs, and performance data will stand out to both investors and public companies looking to comply with emerging disclosure regulations.\n  \n\n\nESG is a Competitive Advantage in the Procurement Process  According to a report by McKinsey & Company, as much as 90% of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts are the results of companies’ supply chains. Active supply chain management is an inherent requirement for reducing a company’s scope three emissions and achieving net zero. As companies begin to make audacious commitments to Net Zero, Net Positive, and other long-term ESG goals, suppliers who can actively support these efforts by minimizing their own emissions will have a competitive advantage as companies begin to integrate ESG criteria into procurement processes and RFP requirements.\n\n\n\nHuman Capital\nEvents in the past few years have revealed how social issues can influence stakeholder expectations of a company’s approach to human capital management. Movements like #Metoo and Black Lives Matter are just a few examples that have impacted the corporate world. These trends compel institutions to revisit and reevaluate their human rights and labor management practices. In other words, they are reassessing and reprioritizing the “S” in their ESG practice. Suppliers are not exempt from these efforts. Within every supply chain are some of the most significant risks regarding human rights violations. Child labor, wage rights, equitable hiring practices, and safe working environments are all challenges companies must account for along their value chain.\n\n\nStrong ESG engagement gives suppliers a license to operate and a competitive advantage when working with public-facing brands. It also helps limit harmful exposure from lawsuits and associated losses, as Nike experienced in the ’90s after being sued for child labor in their factories.\n\n\nMoreover, ESG is an essential component of modern corporate talent management. Millennials and Gen-Z, who will comprise most of the workforce by 2025, view ESG as an absolute necessity for becoming a customer or employee of a company. Employees indicate that they are more likely to stay at a company that is responsible and accountable for its impact. Suppliers, like all entities in ‘the age of ESG,’ should view ESG as a critical component of their talent engagement, retention, and effectiveness efforts.\n\n\n\nESG is the new normal of Supply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management presents one of the greatest leverage points for mitigating a company’s environmental and social impacts.  It also offers one of the greatest opportunities for reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and ensuring long-term stability in a rapidly changing world and marketplace.  Focus on integrating ESG into your supply chain practices today so you can be prepared for the realities of tomorrow.\nBack to the blogPrivacy Policy · ESG · Security · TermsProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingServicesCRANE ToolCompanyHomeOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactESG BlogRho Impact NewsSign up for our NewsletterGet the latest news and articles to your inbox every month.EmailThanks for subscribing!",

I dove into the trials and tribulations of strategy, finance, and economics. I read case study upon case study. I participated in extracurricular consulting competitions. And don’t get me wrong, it was a  great education. I loved being taught by professors distinguished in their field and learning from my peers whose perspectives were different from mine. The reality is, however, it did not prepare me for a job as an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst.\n\nYou might think this doesn’t apply to you if you don’t work directly in ESG. What would an investment banker need to know about carbon emissions or Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)?  The truth is that in today’s ‘new normal’, all jobs need some level of ESG orientation at a functional level to prepare for the future. We are all in the same boat, and currently, it's sinking. It seems I’m not the only one who feels this way. According to the Global Business Coalition For Education, “while job postings requiring green skills grew at 8% annually between 2017–2022, the share of green talent has grown only 6% in the same period” meaning business schools are lacking in providing the education necessary to prepare society for the transition to a net-zero economy. \n\n\nWe already live in a world in which increased regulatory and stakeholder pressures are driving companies to make net-zero pledges. It is nearly impossible to do so, however, without closing this gap between the supply and demand for ESG talent. Large companies like Deloitte, PwC, and Bain, are investing massively in education and training initiatives for their employees to help close this gap. But how is it that our education system is falling short not only of what is expected, but also of what is necessary to succeed?\n\n\nThe truth is that business schools are lacking in preparing their students for jobs in the new normal of business, a new normal in which ESG has landed front and center. Not only does this inhibit companies trying to reach net-zero pledges, but it also slows our society’s progress on reducing, transitioning and adapting to climate change. In order to meet the growing regulatory and stakeholder demands of transitioning to a net-zero economy, business schools need to step up their game and supply their students with ESG knowledge, skills, and credentials. If I were a betting woman, I’d put my money on the next three points:\n\n1 - We Need New Case Studies\nI’m a big fan of the case study method. I like the idea of using real-world situations to gain a deeper understanding of complex problem solving. I learned a lot about strategy by-way of classic Harvard Business School (HBS) case studies throughout my time in graduate school. Most cases were about classic strategic business concepts like competitive advantage, inimitability, and horizontal and vertical integration. Today, ESG strategies are becoming an essential part of how businesses operate, yet in class we barely grazed the surface of how to use different tools, like Porter’s Five Forces, to manage topics such as carbon emissions, DEI solutions, and organizational transparency.\nMy work today requires me to focus heavily on  strategy, but not in the traditional sense. Yes, having an ESG strategy is a strong competitive advantage nowadays, but what exactly encompasses an ESG strategy? What are the pillars that drive an ESG strategic plan? I’ve learned that materiality assessments and disclosure requirements serve as the basis for any robust ESG strategy. Instead of looking at the market and analyzing competitors, we are analyzing ourselves. Strong ESG strategic planning sets hard objectives and metrics. We measure financial and non-financial performance, giving us a holistic view of the risks and opportunities at hand. Finally, the input of all stakeholders is necessary to make an ESG strategy as strong as possible. It’s not just a process involving the C-suite and board of directors; here, everyone is involved as a decision-maker and problem solver.\n\nThis type of strategic thinking should be honed in business schools through a variety of newer case studies. There are examples everywhere in today’s world, and understanding strategy in a more diverse way can strengthen problem-solving capabilities. Even when building out a regular corporate strategy, ESG can serve as a strong differentiator.  Consumers are drawn to companies that push renewables in their supply chains, have responsible labor practices, and focus on having a strong impact in their communities. In other words, today’s ‘new normal’ emphasizes ESG and we should learn how to manage its implications through a strategy lens if we want to strengthen the overall direction of the businesses. Case studies are a great way to learn about its complexities through real-world examples.\n\n2 - Let’s Talk Carbon Accounting\n\nCarbon accounting serves as the basis for any discussion regarding carbon neutrality, which is currently a big focus for businesses world-wide. The E of ESG has become the main focus in any discussion of carbon neutrality or net-zero. By definition, Greenhouse Gas accounting quantifies a company’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and supports proper goal-setting and reduction planning. Since it's important to have some sort of functional understanding of every part of a business, I would have benefited from learning how to measure a company’s climate impact, not only its financial impact. Today, all companies need to engage in carbon accounting  in order to meet increasing regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations regarding emissions and climate risk disclosures. For instance, customers are expecting companies to be transparent with their GHG emissions numbers and long-term goals, with customers willing to pay a premium for products and services provided by a more sustainable company versus a conventional competitor.\n\n\nI'm an analyst, not an accountant or data scientist, yet the topic of GHG accounting comes up a lot in my day-to-day life now. And it sucks to admit, but it's the truth: I still have no idea how carbon accounting actually works. But thanks to my colleagues at Rho Impact, you better believe I’m getting there. If business school would have taught me about the fundamentals of carbon accounting, I would be in a better position to assist our clients in their carbon reduction efforts and long-term planning. So, business schools, if you’re reading this (and I’m looking at you University of Michigan) , it’s time to teach students not only how to measure financial impact but also climate impact. This will ensure everyone is on board in reducing carbon emissions, whatever your professional role may be.\n\n3 - Managing the Regulatory Environment\n\nOne of the first projects I worked on was providing a summary of ESG regulations in major markets around the world. Business Law was one of the core classes for my graduate degree, yet there was no mention of ESG regulations. Business law is complicated and nuanced, yet seems to be set in stone. There is a set way to go about things, as it's an established field with a great amount of precedent. The ESG regulatory environment, on the other hand, is fresh. It is rapidly evolving and is full of uncharted territory. Most of the regulatory environment around ESG has to do with disclosure regulations, and while the issues we are talking about are not new, the fact that we now have to measure and manage them is.\n\n\nMaterial issues such as carbon emissions, diversity in the workplace, and organizational transparency have always been relevant. The difference is that now businesses are required to measure and manage them. There is a significant gap between the understanding of such issues and how to accurately account for them. In such an unprecedented environment, it becomes difficult to disclose a company’s material issues without fully understanding how to quantify them. In business school, I learned about things such as patent law and how to set up LLCs. And while, again, it's important to have a basic understanding of business law, it would have also been helpful to understand that there are spaces where law practices are unprecedented, and that all law isn’t just set in stone. When it comes to law, working in ESG means having to stay current with the science and data that is informing the continuously evolving regulatory environment.\n\nConclusion\n\nJust like everyone, I’m learning on the job. My company has been a huge support in educating me on the fundamentals of working in ESG and in giving me the tools necessary to understand its nuances. However, the question still remains: could business school have actually set me up for success in my field? The answer is no, not in its current state. The reality is that higher education institutions need to focus more on how we should apply the concepts learned in class for the realities of today’s business arena. We leave business school with a general understanding of strategy and accounting, but when it comes to applying them, there is a big gap that needs to be filled. It is becoming ever more important to learn how to apply the concepts we learn to ESG, in order to actually help businesses transform. Without application, all we can do is talk concepts. Business schools, students are looking for more. We are looking for a comprehensive education that reflects the fact that ESG is becoming a reality in every function of a business. We don’t only want to understand business, we want to be able to practice it, and that’s virtually impossible in today’s world without learning about and applying ESG concepts and frameworks to real-world situations.\nBack to the blogPrivacy Policy · ESG · Security · TermsProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingServicesCRANE ToolCompanyHomeOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactESG BlogRho Impact NewsSign up for our NewsletterGet the latest news and articles to your inbox every month.EmailThanks for subscribing!",
    "https://rhoimpact.com/esg-blog/commentary-on-the-sec-proposed-regulation/": "Moving Forward with the SEC’s Proposed ESG Regulations |Rho ImpactServicesProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingCRANE ToolAboutOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactNewsESG BlogPress ReleaseMedia CoverageCareersJob OpportunitiesBenefitsSign inContact UsMenuServicesProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingCRANE ToolNewsESG BlogPress ReleaseMedia CoverageAboutOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactCareersJob OpeningsBenefitsContact UsMoving Forward with the SEC’s Proposed ESG RegulationsBy  · July 06, 202236 years have passed since the term greenwashing was coined by New York environmentalist Jay Westerveld in 1986. The term refers to companies' marketing and PR tactics that deceptively persuade the public to believe that their products, aims, and policies are environmentally friendly. Since then, we’ve seen massive growth in the ESG space. This has unsurprisingly led to an increase in greenwashing activity from corporate entities claiming to be mission and impact-driven. Experts in the space believe that the only way to end greenwashing is to create a reporting system built on transparency. The question everyone’s been asking is will the SEC's new regulations meet this need and officially put an end to greenwashing?\n\n\nIn March 2022, the SEC published its proposed climate-related disclosure rules. For the first time, U.S. companies will be obligated to provide information on the climate risks associated with their operations, and how they plan to mitigate those risks (see our post from June 03, 2022). These proposed regulations require public corporate entities to disclose vital information on their ESG activity, specifically as it relates to climate-related risks and emissions. This means that companies will need to identify and list what issues are material to their business, how these issues impact their business, and how they plan to mitigate that impact. Additionally, companies will be required to disclose their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3, if deemed material. The regulations also include a number of nuanced details regarding climate-related goals, transition plans, data inclusions, and in-line calculations of the financial impact of the identified material risks. The SEC has also released proposed regulations that elaborate on the specific standards that investors will be required to follow. These are designed to complement the reporting elements that are now required of corporate entities to ensure that ESG investments are following similar criteria for disclosure and transparency.\n\nSEC’s Open Commentary Period for Proposed Regulations:\n\nThe SEC originally requested for public feedback to be submitted by May 10th. This deadline was extended to June 17th, as they recognized the attention this proposal has received. Given the public’s increased interest, the SEC made the smart decision to extend the commentary period, giving interested parties extra time to thoughtfully curate their submissions. Now that the commentary period has closed, the SEC will review each submission and determine if and how to integrate them. When finalized, these regulations will have a big impact on the ESG space, signifying a new era of climate-related reporting. These proposals will be one of the first U.S. regulations put in place to require public (and some private) corporate entities to disclose vital non-financial information. Given those implications, we at Rho Impact felt obligated to provide commentary and contribute to this important development. Using our technical knowledge and practical expertise, our commentary suggested a robust baseline for climate-related disclosures in the hopes of enabling systematic improvements over time.\n\nWhat Did we Include in our Commentary to the SEC:\n\nIn our commentary, we suggest that the SEC’s regulations should encourage a higher level of disclosure. Such disclosure will allow for meaningful auditability, traceability, and ultimately transparency. To achieve those goals, we focused more on the process of generating the ESG metrics, rather than simply stating the output values. In doing so, the regulations should incentivise corporate entities to uncover and engage with all their material issues, not just the ones they can report positive performance on. Companies should also provide details on the inputs and outputs used to calculate metrics like emissions data or financial estimates of climate-related risk. Providing these assumptions and process details creates added context and clarity needed to properly understand how they arrived at these reported values.\n\n\nThis level of transparency can be achieved by focusing on three prominent topics discussed in the proposed regulations: Materiality, Scope 3 Emissions and Financial Calculations.\n\n\n\nMateriality: Currently, the disclosure of material issues is left to the company’s discretion. In our opinion, the SEC should prescribe process guidelines for how material issues are identified. Only through a thorough stakeholder engagement exercise can all materially relevant issues be identified. By requiring this process instead of leaving it up to the reporting entity to sufficiently list the issues, we can reduce gaps in the analysis and promote greater transparency regarding the actions undertaken to arrive at those conclusions.\n\n\n\nScope 3 Emissions: Protocols for disclosing scope 3 emissions must include detailed information on both the inputs (i.e., materials or products purchased from suppliers) and outputs (i.e., materials or products sold, waste created). Not accounting for the inputs and assumptions (hidden or otherwise) could create discrepancies between emissions calculations and the final, reported emissions numbers. Additionally, simply stating one value for Scope 3 emissions does nothing to articulate the interactions along a company’s value chain that contribute to this Scope 3 value.\n\n\n\nFinancial Calculations: Similarly, asking for a single, quantified financial value regarding how ESG issues may impact future profitability could result in manipulated and misrepresented data. It could also increase the confusion and skepticism in the markets due to a lack of supporting detail. Listing key assumptions, secondary data points, and any methodologies used to support quantitative results would reduce the uncertainty and increase transparency.\n\n\n\nIt is our stance that providing investors and other stakeholders with greater detail regarding the processes, key inputs, and internal controls used to determine a company’s performance data will positively influence the system of reporting as a whole. It will also go a long way in promoting “Consistent, comparable, and reliable reporting” as said by the SEC regarding their intentions with these proposals.  Increasing the depth and transparency of corporate ESG disclosure will be a critical component in eliminating greenwashing. The full extent of our commentary can be found directly on the SEC’s website.\n\nRome wasn’t built in a day- Why Commenting on the SEC’s Proposed Regulations is so important:\n\nMany comments were made on the SEC’s proposed regulation, with interest from the likes of all-too popular “Impact Investor” Blackrock, as well as political representatives who still view the issue of climate change as a ‘Right vs Left’ debate.  Some expressed a very critical view, suggesting that these disclosures will bring an undue burden and extreme costs for businesses. However, we believe that these regulations need to be celebrated! They are the first steps in a long journey towards implementing ESG regulations that will account for all the challenges this space presents. Educating the market and creating effective behavioral changes will take some time. There will be some trial and error, but as the old adage goes, ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day.’ Looking at the state of ESG in the EU reveals that progression in this space takes times. The EU Council and European Parliament announced earlier this week (June 2022) that they have reached an agreement on the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) rules. This regulation has been in the making for years, aimed to update the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) from 2014. The EU is much further ahead in these developments, and as we’d expect, the SEC’s proposals will likely take some time to pass through our legislative process, but you can see that by setting the bar high and establishing a solid base, we can create an effective and valuable reporting system. Therefore, with our comments, it is our objective to instill these values and ensure that the baseline we establish now sets us up for success in the future. If done right, we can enable better reporting processes, data collection, and metrics calculations, with the ultimate goal of providing important context and useful insight to all stakeholders.\n\nWhat will the new SEC regulations mean for US Based companies?\n\nAccording to the SEC, public comments will be finalized in late September, with formal SEC guidance enacted as early as October of this year. The goal then is to have large accelerated filers report on these elements starting in 2023, with all companies being expected to report by 2024. This means that public entities (and their private counterparts/partners) will need to begin developing these capabilities now in order to be fully prepared to report by 2023. Failure to do so will result in SEC sanctions and investigations, which have already been issued at major companies like Deutche Bank and Tesla.\n\n\nFor U.S. Based companies, the finalization of these proposals will dictate what companies need to include in their non-financial reporting. These reports will be much more structured than what is currently required. In addition, they will need to include supporting data and documentation to back up the claims they are making in these reports. This means new procedures for measuring, storing, and sharing data as well as new data structures that will enable the use of these new data types. For some, this will mean identifying the internal functional areas that can support these new processes. For others, it means building out new departments entirely. Without internal consensus and a dedicated team of employees, you will be sure to run into some trouble.\n\n\nPrivate companies should also be prepared to report on their ESG efforts. Any private company that works with a public entity will be called upon to report their ESG practices and emissions levels to round out scope 3. Some companies have already begun adding ESG criteria to their supplier requirements, as a lot of their emissions are tied up in the value chain. Reducing that footprint or achieving a net-zero strategy, for most public companies, will rely heavily on working with suppliers and partners whose ESG priorities align with theirs.  Private companies should be aware that developing these ESG capabilities and having this information on hand, will be crucial for winning procurement bids and renewing contracts with major public brands.\n\n\nAs the EU Parliament’s lead negotiator Pascal Durand said: “Today, information on a company’s impact on the environment, human rights, and work ethics is patchy, unreliable, and easily abused. Some companies do not report. Others report on what they want. Investors, consumers, and shareholders are at loss. From now on, having a clean human rights record will be just as important as having a clean balance sheet.” It is with this sentiment that we welcome in a new era of corporate transparency and reporting. One in which all stakeholders can make effective judgements on a company’s non-financial performance, and investors care about an investment’s ESG rating just as much as they care about its ROI.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about the ESG regulatory state of affairs, our stance on the SEC’s recent proposals, or if you want to learn how your company can start preparing for these reporting requirements,  feel free to send us an email.\nBack to the blogPrivacy Policy · ESG · Security · TermsProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingServicesCRANE ToolCompanyHomeOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactESG BlogRho Impact NewsSign up for our NewsletterGet the latest news and articles to your inbox every month.EmailThanks for subscribing!",

In tandem with these disclosure standards, the IFRS has drafted a Sustainability Disclosure Taxonomy supporting the digital consumption of the disclosed data. At Rho Impact, we frequently collect and transform large quantities of sustainability data, thereby motivating us to review and provide feedback on the staff draft of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Taxonomy. In this post, we will highlight the importance of this Taxonomy and the key recommendations we made. Our full response to the IFRS can be found here.\n\nIFRS Sustainability Disclosure Taxonomy Overview\n\nThe IFRS Foundation established the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop climate-related financial disclosure standards. These standards seek to enable globally consistent disclosures about organizational risks related to climate change and other sustainability issues. Two exposure drafts, one on sustainability and one on climate, were published earlier this year. CDP has already announced that, beginning in 2024, the thousands of companies that report environmental data through CDP will be doing so using the forthcoming IFRS climate-related disclosure standards.\n\n\nWe are enthusiastic about these efforts because of the urgency for the ESG and impact communities to converge on a set of metrics. The space needs metrics and data handling protocols that are transparent and built to evolve with the necessary alacrity. Further, to provide actionable insights on the metrics reported in these disclosures, it is essential that the information be built to integrate with conventional data exchange methods (e.g., APIs) and in universally accessible language formats (e.g., XBRL). This impending surge of sustainability-related big data has the potential to provide new insights into high-impact areas for innovation.\n\n\nCompanies and their stakeholders increasingly need access to digitized sustainability-related information to understand an entity’s environmental, social, and governance performance. Recent advances in computational tools have allowed for rapid ingestion and automated calculation of impact-related data, but a lack of consistency, both in terms of the metrics and the data formatting, slows progress on risk reduction. A challenge that we encounter daily is how disparate information is, even within a single organization, thereby making it extremely difficult to measure and assess ESG risks. We envision a future where sustainability-related data are as trackable and globally consistent as financial data, but there needs to be systems in place to support these efforts. Therefore, we applaud the IFRS for their efforts in developing the disclosure standards and associated Taxonomy. In particular, we are thrilled about the explicit efforts to code sustainability data in a way that facilitates facile analytics, cross-industry data sharing and comparison (i.e., structured electronic tagging).\n\n\nThe Taxonomy covers a range of topics including the organization of sustainability-related financial information, tagging requirements, representation of narrative versus quantitative information, inter-report connectivity, and metrics modeling. The full Taxonomy draft can be found here. Below is a summary of our key recommendations that we believe will help improve the Taxonomy as it is applied now and in the future.\n\nOur Taxonomy Recommendations\n\n\n\nDesigning the Taxonomy to accommodate new metrics and enhance existing metricsWe are especially focused on the Taxonomy being designed to accommodate new metrics or change existing ones. Due to the rapid evolution of sustainability measurement and analysis tools, we recommend a specific protocol be included for metric additions or modifications, as well as flexibility in how the relevant data are disclosed. Such a Taxonomy protocol should include a process for developing, proposing, and adding custom metric elements. Moreover, we recommend the inclusion of forward-looking metrics, such as \"Emissions Reduction Potential.\"In regards to the flexibility mentioned above, we would like to see broader metrics categories that allow for organizations to report data that are verifiable and aligned with their relevant metrics, rather than a set of prescriptive metrics categories that may become outdated quickly. Further, providing companies with the opportunity to transparently show the underlying data for a given metric is equally as important as the metric category itself.Through our experience working with stakeholders who follow different standards, and because standards (and disclosure needs) will change, we have found that overly prescriptive metrics and requirements can hinder sustainable development. This is because such metrics may not reveal the most relevant impacts of certain activities. For example, the SASB metrics for Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry are largely focused on supplier compliance with specific environmental data assessments and raw material certifications from a third-party. While this may highlight a supply chain that is aligned with environmental standards, it does not encourage sustainable innovation. A more specific disclosure that clarifies areas for improvement may include information around the percentage of raw textile materials that are reused or repurposed from existing materials, or identify carcinogenic chemicals used in textile dyeing and associated worker exposure risks.\n  \n\n\nUseful digital reporting necessitates high-resolution tagging We strongly support the plan for detailed tagging of specific data points and would suggest that every effort be made to enable high-resolution tagging, organizing, encrypting, and secure data sharing as part of a truly robust digital ecosystem for sustainability data. High-resolution tagging is extraordinarily useful for analysts who need to categorize and interpret data in a variety of ways and across platforms.\n\n\n\nFocusing on data and process transparencyThe Taxonomy should encourage reporting entities to focus primarily on reporting only the materially relevant, verifiable, and contextualized information – concrete information and fewer hand- or algorithmically-derived summary metrics. This should include transparent documentation around the process used to collect specific evidence and convert it into the reported values. In our experience, organizations can readily report the “facts on the ground” about their activities, such as the number of fleet vehicles they own and the fuel consumption of those vehicles. The current challenge for many organizations is to translate this information into standardized metrics, for example, non-stationary Scope 1 emissions.We think that there is a real benefit in shifting the responsibility of deep analysis from the organization itself to the subject matter experts, including both standards setters as well as sustainability analytics providers. By having an organization provide raw data, and leaving analysts/subject matter experts to transform the data into relevant metrics, there is a lower barrier of entry for organizations and preparers to comply with disclosure standards. As a result, the reported metrics are likely to be more accurate. Further, if subject matter experts are the ones designing the methodologies and performing the metrics analyses, they are less likely to be biased in the application of analytical methods. Similar to how companies use external accountants and auditors, subject matter experts are positioned to take a broader and more systematic view of parsing high granularity data.\n\n\n\nIncreasing taxonomy ease of useThe issues raised by the IFRS staff in their Taxonomy draft for feedback highlight the many aspects of sustainability-related financial disclosure reporting. To accommodate users of this Taxonomy, it would be helpful to include a complete sustainability disclosure example document with annotations describing the various Taxonomy components (e.g., categorized elements, narrative elements, hierarchical ordering of data, etc.). Currently, synthesizing all of the guidance in the Taxonomy is somewhat challenging due to its lack of a comprehensive, downloadable example. Few things teach as well as examples!\n\nAs the community approaches a more standardized set of metrics and best practices, stakeholders will be equipped to better assess and use a company’s ESG and impact information in a meaningful way. We believe that this will provide critical tailwinds to the corporate sustainability movement in a way that focuses on verifiable actions, especially on climate resilience. We appreciate the IFRS facilitating the advancement of these drafts in a way that directly benefits all stakeholders. The advancement of sustainability-related big data will enable new aggregate analyses and it is our hope that the underlying data and metrics will be sufficiently robust to provide meaningful directions for sustainable development.\nBack to the blogPrivacy Policy · ESG · Security · TermsProductsGemini FeaturesGemini PricingServicesCRANE ToolCompanyHomeOur CompanyOur TeamOur ImpactESG BlogRho Impact NewsSign up for our NewsletterGet the latest news and articles to your inbox every month.EmailThanks for subscribing!",

We are on a mission to empower every organization to make an impact. Read on to learn a little more about Rho Impact, our origin story, and see some of the ways we try to make a direct impact through pro bono and volunteer work.Rho Impact is a multi-disciplinary team of ESG strategists, environmental scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs, and social innovators. No matter where you are in your impact journey - whether that be Net Zero planning, ESG strategy development, decarbonizing an investment portfolio, or square one - we can help to get you where you want to go.Rho Impact was built upon Rho AI's decade of experience in solving real world problems with data science and software development.Our involvement in what is now the CRANE Tool was the direct result of our partnership with Prime Coalition, which has long been a foundational leader in advancing the field of catalytic capital. In 2018 Prime and NYSERDA published a seminal report entitled, \"Climate Impact Assessment for Early-Stage Ventures,\" in which they laid the foundation for everything that has been built today.Our experience with emission reduction forecasting for early-stage ventures revealed the need to reliably forecast the effectiveness of enterprise climate change interventions. Whether it be a climate risk, ESG, or corporate impact strategy, we have applied this thinking to address the key barriers corporations face in achieving their triple bottom-line impacts for the planet, people, and profits. We aim to simplify the impact planning, tracking, and reporting process so you can achieve the impact you're capable of and that society desperately needs.The path to impactIn 2012, we began our journey in motorsports by building \"Pit Rho,\" an innovative set of tools and infrastructure used to predict optimal race strategy in real-time during NASCAR events.As we matured in applying data science and software engineering across the fields of motorsports, energy, finance, healthcare, and others, we recognized an internal motivation was solidifying to use these core competencies to help solve some of the world's bigger problems.In 2018 we made the decision to dedicate a significant portion of our team to climate-focused projects. By 2020 we knew it was time to fully lean in and in 2021 we spun out Rho Impact as an entirely new company with a simple mission baked into its name: to do everything we can make a positive impact.Early Opportunity2012The Founding IdeaRho AI begins applying data science, machine learning, and bespoke software development to address a key need for faster and more actionable strategy options, in real-time, during competitive motorsports. We bootstrapped the company and learned a lot, often the hard way, about what it takes to apply data science to real-world problems.2015Beyond MotorsportsWith a functional & growing motorsports product and some experience under our belts, Rho AI begins to work for and partner with organizations such as Rubicon Global, XLHybrids, and Zero Mass Water across industries as varied as financial services, healthcare, and energy.Promising Partnerships2017Department of Energy and the Prime CoalitionRho AI is selected for an initiative by the DOE's office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) to use artificial intelligence and data science to efficiently connect investors to startups in the energy sector.In 2018, Rho AI is tapped by the Prime Coalition to help drive catalytic capital by developing the CRANE Tool - open-source software for assessing the carbon reduction potential of new enterprises and emerging technologies.2020Expanding Work with Leading Impact OrganizationsCRANE is publicly launched in collaboration with Prime, Rho AI, Greenometry, and the Clean Energy Trust.Rho AI is brought on board by Breakthrough Energy to support the development of their Emerging Climate Technology Framework (ECTF) in collaboration with CDP.The MaRS Discovery District partners with Rho AI and leverages the CRANE methodology to evaluate the potential impact of their climate tech competition applicants.Rho Impact is Born2021Rho AI Doubles Down on ImpactAfter over 3 years of CRANE development and initial public use, CRANE's Custom Technology module is released and an in-depth CRANE user report is published.Bravos Energia engages Rho AI to support development of grid optimization software for the Texas grid and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)In October, 2021 Rho Impact is officially founded. With enthusiasm and humility, we are building off of the founding team's decades of experience and thought leadership in ESG consulting, software engineering, and data science. We hope to have the opportunity to work with you and work for a better planet, together.Get your ESG DigestGet the latest news and articles to your inbox every month.SubscribeNo spam.
